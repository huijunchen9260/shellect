## Dependency

1. POSIX-compliant shell: printf, set, unset, shift, test, while, continue, break, return, case, trap, getopts
2. stty
3. dd
4. cat

## Introduction

shellect will either accept standard input or assign the display content by `-c` option, i.e., to display all the non-hidden files and directories in your `$HOME` directory,

```sh
printf '%s\n' $HOME/* | shellect # standard input
shellect -c "$HOME/*"	       # -c option

```

The keybindings are:

```
k/↑/Ctrl-p - up
j/↓/Ctrl-n - down
l/→ - right
h/← - left
Ctrl-f/PageDown - PageDown
Ctrl-u/PageUp - PageUp
g/Home/Ctrl-a - go to top
G/End/Ctrl-e - go to bottom
/ - search
? - show keybinds
q - quit
```

Command-line option:

```
Usage:

shellect [OPTIONS] ([ARGS])

  -h,			Show help options
  -i,			Set case-insensitive search
  -l,			Set live-search
  -n=[num],		Set numbers of line per entry
  -d=[delim],		Set delimiter (IFS, internal field separator)
  -c=[content],		Set content to display
  -f=[format],		Set the format to print out content
  -t=[msg],		Set top status bar message
  -b=[msg],		Set bottom status bar message

format detail:
  nldel			delete last nl, equiv to "\${1%\$nl}"
  basename		only print basename, equiv to "\${1##*/}" ;;

  if unset or empty, then equiv to "\$1"

live-search detail:
  Enter 		confirm
  Backspace 		delete previous character
  Tab 			Tab-completion forward
  Shift-Tab		Tab-completion backward
  control char		ignore
  others		print out
```

## Implementation Details

shellect born from my experience in developing my bibliography manager, [`shbib`](https://github.com/huijunchen9260/shbib), and I built [`shbib`](https://github.com/huijunchen9260/shbib) on the basis provided by [`shfm`](https://github.com/dylanaraps/shfm). I realized that if I do not obey the Unix philosophy and keep adding functions to [`shbib`](https://github.com/huijunchen9260/shbib), [`shbib`](https://github.com/huijunchen9260/shbib) would grow exponentially and eventually become a pain to maintain. Therefore, I isolate out shellect as an individual selection system that just written in POSIX shell.

### Explanation for TUI manipulation

Basically, printing out the raw escape sequence to manipulate the terminal output works in most terminal, and its function is way richer than `tput`.
However, printing out these escape sequence can be daunting, and it is often time-consuming to remember the function of each arbitrary sequence.
Thus, The following `esc` function is steal from [`shfm`](https://github.com/dylanaraps/shfm), with some of my own comment and modification to facilitate the understanding.
All of the resource can be found in the following three resources:

- Reference for color: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#CSI_sequences
- Reference for vt100: https://vt100.net/docs/vt510-rm/contents.html
- Reference for escape sequence: https://github.com/dylanaraps/pure-sh-bible#escape-sequences

```sh
esc() {
    case $1 in
        # vt100 (IL is vt102) (DECTCEM is vt520)
	CUP)     printf '%s[%s;%sH' "$esc_c" "$2" "$3" ;;
	    # cursor to LINES($2), COLUMNS($3)

### Overcome the limitation of POSIX shell

POSIX shell is very limited, and quite inefficient compared to compiling language.
Previously, I experimented the efficiency of POSIX shell in terms of passing through all the argument array elements into the key detecting part:

> The efficiency of shellect is highly constraint by the total number of entries and the content that you want to display.
> With `bash`, as I tested, probably only numbers of 5000 is large enough to create significant lag. The command I run is `tree /directory/have/5000/subitems | shellect` or `echo $(seq 1 5000) | shellect`.
> With `dash`, the efficiency is highly depends on both directions. At the number 20000, shellect runs fair efficiency. The command is `tree /directory/have/20000/subitems | shellect`. With the number of 30000, the pointer will not stop if I relieve my key press. However, changing the command to `echo $(seq 1 30000) | shellect`, in my computer, shellect runs with fair efficiency.
> Comparing with `dmenu` and `fzf`, shellect is probably extremely inefficient in terms of large numbers of entry. This is probably the limitation of an interpreting language compared to compiling language.

As an interpreting language, I found a way to avoid such inefficiency.

First, I'll define some terminologies that I'll use through the explanation:

1. argument array: POSIX shell has no array type. However, there's actually one, and only one array in POSIX shell, i.e., the positional parameters, `$1`, `$2`, etc.
To see more information, go to "Working with arrays" section in [Rich’s sh (POSIX shell) tricks](http://www.etalabs.net/sh_tricks.html).
2. selection: the item in argument array that is defined in `$cur`.
3. Length of array: access by `$#`. The length of the total content is `$last`, and the length of a list is `$len`. `$len` is set to 500 if the length of the total content, `$last`, is larger than 500.


```sh
    while key=$(dd ibs=1 count=1 2>/dev/null); do
    ...
    done
```

This `while` loop is the part to detect key press.
This `dd` command has nothing to interact with the argument array.
However, `dd`'s efficiency will be highly affected by argument array that just pass through it.
If the total number of argument array is too high, then `dd` will become laggy when reading the key press, eventually causing the cursor movement is laggy.

To resolve this limitation. I developed a technique to only feed part of the total content to the above while loop:

```sh
key() {
    input_assign ...  # Generate a list which is part of the total content

    set -- $list # let the list to be argument array

    while key=$(dd ibs=1 count=1 2>/dev/null); do
    ...
	othercommand
	return 0 # Go back to main function and stay in the while loop in main function
    ...
	selection key pressed
	return 1 # Go back to main and leave the while loop in main function
    done
}

main() {
    ...
    while [ $? -eq 0 ]; do # If return 0, stay in while loop; others, leave the while loop
	set -- $content	# total content
	key "$@"
    done
}
```

The following steps are to actively switch between `main` function and `key` function.
Within the `$list`, the selection stay in the `while key` loop. If the current selection ever go out of the `$list`, then go back to `main` function, reload the `$content` and generate new `$list`, back to `while key` loop, and process again.
That is to say, user will experience an one-time inaction when reach the boundary of `$list`.
This inaction is to renew `$list` to match current position in the whole `$content`.
Press again, and the selection will move to the next item.
